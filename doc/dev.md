# Implementation details

- cli readline uses raw mode so blocks ctrl-c to become a SIGINT
- TODO: `scope` and `scopedump` functions used to implement REPL completion
- TODO: Custom object interface used to traverse fq's field tree and to allowing a terse
syntax for comparing and working with fields, accessing child fields and special properties like `_range`.
